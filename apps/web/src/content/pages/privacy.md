Marble ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our service ("the Service").

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect only the information necessary to provide and improve our service:

### a. Account Information

- **What we collect:** Basic details such as your name, email address, and OAuth provider IDs (e.g., Google, GitHub) when you sign up.
- **Why we collect it:** To create and manage your account, authenticate you, and provide access to your workspaces.

### b. Workspace Data

- **What we collect:** Content you create within the Service (e.g., posts, tags, workspace metadata).
- **Why we collect it:** To deliver the core functionality of the CMS and allow collaboration.

### c. AI Features (Optional)

- **What we process:** When you use our AI-powered features, your workspace data (e.g., “posts tagged ‘design’”) may be temporarily processed to generate responses.
- **What we don’t do:** We do not use your data to train external AI models without your consent.

### d. Analytics Data

- **What we collect:** Non-identifiable usage data such as page views, timestamps, and browser type.
- **Provider:** We use Databuddy.cc, a GDPR-compliant analytics provider that does not track individuals.
- **Why we collect it:** To monitor performance and improve the Service.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- Provide and operate the Service.
- Enable authentication and account management.
- Deliver AI-powered features at your request.
- Monitor performance and usage trends.
- Comply with legal obligations.

We do not sell or rent your information to third parties.

## 3. Data Sharing

We may share your information with trusted service providers (e.g., hosting providers, analytics, payment processors, AI infrastructure) who help us operate the Service. These providers are bound by strict confidentiality and data protection obligations.

We may also share data if required by law.

## 4. Data Retention

- Account data is retained for as long as your account is active.
- Workspace data is retained until you delete it or request deletion.
- Analytics data is retained only as long as necessary for performance monitoring.

You may request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us at [support@marblecms.com](mailto:support@marblecms.com).

## 5. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you may have the right to:

- Access and receive a copy of your data.
- Request correction or deletion of your data.
- Restrict or object to certain processing.
- Export your data in a portable format.

To exercise these rights, contact us at [support@marblecms.com](mailto:support@marblecms.com).

## 6. Cookies and Tracking

We do not use cookies for tracking. Analytics is handled by Databuddy, which does not identify individual users.

## 7. Security Measures

We use industry-standard measures, including encryption in transit and at rest, to protect your data. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If significant changes are made, we will notify you via the Service or email.

## 9. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at: [support@marblecms.com](mailto:support@marblecms.com)
